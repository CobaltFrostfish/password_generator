## The project
In this project I was tasked with taking an existing HTML document styled with CSS and adding JavaScript elements in order to make a functioning password generator. Within the generator you're prompted with multiple options as to what type of character inclusions you would like to add to your password. The addition of these optional inclusions make it possible for the user to generator a password as secure as they need it to be.

## Technologies applied
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
